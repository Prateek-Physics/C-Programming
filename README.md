# C-Programming
Its is the repository where you can find C programs to solve various mathematical (though physics centred) problems. Plot them using GNUPLOT, it is expected from user to know how to plot different columns against one another from dat/txt file using GNUPLOT. Images might not be available for all codes. Codes are written in the format "chapter.problem.part_of_problem", for example code 2.2.1 is the code for problem 2.1 of chapter 2
